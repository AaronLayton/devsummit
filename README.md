# Chrome Dev Summit site

The site is based on Google AppEngine, so you'll need the [SDK and launcher](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads).

Once you have that, you'll need to:

1. Launch the GAE launcher (launch a launcher is quite meta)
2. File -> Add an existing project
3. Point it to the cloned folder
4. Start it and go to http://localhost:8080
